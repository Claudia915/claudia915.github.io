# My Journey through my first DH class

Hello! This semester I took my first digital humanities course at Penn and learned a whole new area of study. In this page I will go through my journey, projects, failures and successs throughout this course. Now having completed the course I will reflect on the skills and knowledge I am able to take with me and what I hope to do with them in the future. 

## Reflecting on the Projects I participated in 

## First Time Attending a Workshop at Penn!

A large component of this course included the requirement of attending a workshop at Penn. The purpose of this was to engage with digital humanities through an on-hands experience and learn about these opportunities on campus.
