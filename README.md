# My Journey through my first DH class

Hello! My name is Claudia Merchan and I am currently a sophomore in the College of Arts & Sciences majoring in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics. Some background about myself is that I am from Hackensack, New Jersey and for most of my life I've always focused on taking the traditional humanities classes. When arriving to Penn rumors of how difficult most STEM courses are here, steered me away from taking courses that were outside of my comfort zone. This semester, though, in hopes of both fulfillling requirements and branching out, I took my first digital humanities course at Penn and learned a whole new area of study. In this page I will go through my journey, projects, failures and successs throughout this course. Now having completed the course I will reflect on the skills and knowledge I am able to take with me and what I hope to do with them in the future. 

## Reflecting on the projects I participated in 

Here is a link to my [statement where I reflect on my experience in this class](reflection.md) 

## First Time Attending a Workshop at Penn!

A large component of this course included the requirement of attending a workshop at Penn. The purpose of this was to engage with digital humanities through an on-hands experience and learn about these opportunities on campus.

## First Time Attending a Workshop in Philadelphia!

Another large part of the hands-on component of this course was also branching outside of the Penn community and looking into the Philadelphia community for opportunities to engage with Digital Humanities as well.
