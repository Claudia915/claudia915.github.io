# Looking Forward 

Now that I have completed this course I hope to bring the work that Iâ€™ve learned in this class into my future learning by continuing to develop my skills on the GitHub page and creating a repository for personal use such as tracking my college journey. Additionally, I hope to go on and take advantage of the EC and either experiment with some of the tools and create something for myself or participate in another workshop. I think that by completing either of these, I would be able to explore more of the hands-on skills that I gained through this course. Finally, this course has inspired me not to be afraid of enrolling in a more advanced digital humanities course that dives deeper into the practical and theoretical applications of coding languages. By expanding my expertise in these areas, I hope to explore further digital humanities projects that blend computational techniques with cultural and historical analysis.
